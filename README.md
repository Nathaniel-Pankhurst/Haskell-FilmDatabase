# Haskell-FilmDatabase
Haskell Functional Programming coursework completed for Computer Science degree.

## The Task

The task given to me for this coursework was to develop a film ratings program using the Haskell language, 
which lets users add films to the database, give the films a rating between 0 and 1, and displays specific details of the films. 
The site maintains a simple database of the films (consisting of a text file that in my case contains a list of tuples); 
each record (or tuple) in the database needed to give the title of the film, the film's director, the year of the film's release, 
and a list of user's ratings for the film. It was also addressed that in all cases of displaying a film's data on the screen, any instances
where the film's rartings are needed, the average of these ratings were what was needed to be shown, 
and if said film has no ratings then its website rating is automatically 0.

The program was requested to make use of standard functional programming concepts to cover the core functionality of the program,
and then this functional code was required to be backed up by a simple yet robust command-line user interface if we had enough time
to implement the IO functions that were required for this to work.
